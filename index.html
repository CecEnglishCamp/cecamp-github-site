        <h2>About CEC English Camp</h2>
        <p>
          Our journey begins with <strong>Episode 1: The Hidden Warehouse Files</strong> — a short novel that blends action, humor, and heartwarming moments with real English learning. Students follow the adventures of a lovable learning companion robot designed to help children overcome everyday challenges. Every episode leaves them thinking: <em>"I wish I had a robot like that!"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This series inspires kids to revisit the story whenever life feels hard, find courage, and recharge emotionally. Each story episode becomes a springboard for practicing all four core skills: <strong>Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've developed a full curriculum around each short novel episode, helping learners grow naturally and joyfully. And in the near future, they'll even be able to interact with AI-powered versions of their story robots.
