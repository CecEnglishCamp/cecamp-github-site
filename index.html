      <h2>About CEC English Camp</h2>
      <p>
        Our journey begins with <strong>Episode 1: The Hidden Warehouse Files</strong> — a short novel that blends action, humor, and heartwarming moments with real English learning. Students follow the adventures of a lovable learning companion robot designed to help children overcome everyday challenges. Every episode leaves them thinking: <em>"I wish I had a robot like that!"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This series inspires kids to revisit the story whenever life feels hard, find courage, and recharge emotionally. Each story episode becomes a springboard for practicing all four core skills: <strong>Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We've developed a full curriculum around each short novel episode, helping learners grow naturally and joyfully. And in the near future, they'll even be able to interact with AI-powered versions of their story robots.
