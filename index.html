        <p>Our journey begins with <strong>Episode 1: The Hidden Warehouse Files</strong> — # **Season 1, Episode 1**

**Light Lives Beneath the Village**

In Taebaek’s winter of 2025, Miso lingered before the forsaken Jangseong Elementary School, clutching her father’s corroded metal box. The Hwangjeecheon River’s gentle murmur drifted nearby, while a biting breeze grazed her cheeks. Kneeling, she pried open the lid, unveiling faded manuscripts titled “T.O.B.I. Project: Jangseong Mine Heat Recovery System.” Her father’s calligraphy, both unfamiliar and achingly familiar, stirred her. “What were you dreaming of?” she murmured, as if the papers might respond.

Intrigued, Miso approached the derelict mine, its gate marked with a crumbling “No Entry” sign. She shoved it open, and a chill, alien air rushed out. Abruptly, a nimble robot, Jump, leaped onto a metal surface, its azure eyes gleaming. It tilted its head, blinked twice, and projected a hologram: [T.O.B.I. UNIT-2 / JUMP]. Without pause, it darted toward an underground passage. Miso hesitated, then followed, her pulse racing.The lift creaked downward: 80m, 180m, 400m. At 400 meters, damp air enveloped her. Peeling iron walls, mining relics, and dripping water surrounded her. Miso inhaled the musty blend of coal dust and oil. Jump sprang to a wall, activating a cube-like device. With a hum, a panel slid open, and Robo stirred. “T.O.B.I. UNIT-1: ROBO. Standby: 3,672 days,” it intoned, its metallic voice tinged with warmth. “Mine conditions optimal. Groundwater: 9.8°C, 5,000 tons daily. Cooling efficiency 92.4%.” Miso’s breath caught. “A data center?” Robo affirmed, “Correct. Estonia, Finland, Norway precedents validate feasibility. Village heating efficiency 86%.” Jump shifted pipes nearby, clearing space. Miso recalled her father’s script. “Did he create this?”

A tremor jolted the ground. Robo’s eyes flickered rapidly. “Warning: unidentified signal detected. T.O.B.I. protocol violation.” Jump scaled the walls, its gaze piercing the darkness. “Something’s there—not human,” it signaled. Robo’s eyes froze blue. “Unknown system… or Ian?” Miso’s heart pounded, a shiver coursing through her. “This isn’t merely a mine…” She faced Robo and Jump, her resolve unwavering. “We’ll awaken this village. It starts here.” Above, the river’s cadence pulsed like a heartbeat, echoing her vow..</p>
