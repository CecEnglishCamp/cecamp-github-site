          CEC English Camp offers a unique, joy-centered learning journey for children. We believe that language learning should be meaningful, connected to real life, and filled with positive emotional experiences. That’s why our curriculum is designed around short novels, interactive AI tasks, and everyday communication themes.
          <br /><br />
          Our multi-level system (CEFR A1–B2) ensures that each learner starts at their own level and progresses steadily. Weekly programs include thematic vocabulary, listening stories, drama-based role play, grammar coaching, writing prompts, and daily speaking practice with chatbot companions. We support our students through every stage of development with warm, human-centered guidance.
