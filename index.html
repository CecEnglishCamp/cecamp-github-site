            Dear Parents,<br><br>
            At CEC, we believe that language is best learned when it is lived. Our foundational program, Mastery Through Narrative, brings grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure alive through storytelling. <br><br>
            Your child will create and reimagine stories, learning sentence structure and parts of speech in a fun and relatable way. Children move beyond memorization and begin to communicate their own thoughts with growing independence and delight.<br><br>
