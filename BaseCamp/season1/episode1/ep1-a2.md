## Story – A2 English

**Light Lives Under the Village**

In Taebaek, winter 2025, Miso is at an old school. The river makes a soft sound.  
She opens her dad’s rusty box and finds old papers. The plan is called “T.O.B.I. Project” for a mine.  
Miso is curious. She goes to the mine. The gate says “No Entry,” but she opens it.  
Cold air comes out. Jump, a fast robot with blue eyes, appears. Jump takes Miso deep into the mine, 400 meters down.  
There, Robo, another robot, wakes up and says, "This mine can be a data center. It can help the village."  
Miso is excited. Suddenly, the ground shakes. Robo says, "There is danger!"  
Miso says, "We will wake the village!"
