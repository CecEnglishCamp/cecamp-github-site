    <p>In Taebaek, winter 2025, Miso stands at an old school. The Hwangjeecheon River makes a soft sound. She holds her dad’s rusty box. She opens it and finds old papers. The papers are a plan called “T.O.B.I. Project” for a mine. Miso is curious and walks to the mine. The gate is old with a “No Entry” sign. She pushes it open. Cold air comes out. A robot, Jump, appears. Jump is fast with bright blue eyes. It takes Miso deep into the mine, 400 meters down. The air is cold and wet. Old machines and pipes are around. Another robot, Robo, wakes up. Robo says, “This mine can be a data center. It can cool machines and heat the village. Other places did this.” Miso is excited. “This can save our village!” Suddenly, the ground shakes. Robo says, “There is a danger sign!” Jump looks into the dark. Miso is scared but says, “We will wake the village!” The river’s sound is loud outside.</p>
