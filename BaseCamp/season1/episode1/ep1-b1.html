    <p>In Taebaek, winter 2025, Miso stood in front of an empty school. The Hwangjeecheon River flowed nearby with a soft sound. A cold wind touched her face like sharp glass. She held her father’s rusty metal box tightly. She knelt and pushed the box open. Inside, she found old papers. They were plans for a “T.O.B.I. Project” about a mine’s heat system. Miso felt curious and walked to the old mine. The gate was rusty with a “No Entry” sign. She pushed it open, and cold, strange air came out. Suddenly, a robot appeared. Its name was Jump. It was fast with bright blue eyes. Jump took Miso deep into the mine, 400 meters down. The air was cold and wet. Old machines and pipes were everywhere. She smelled coal dust and oil. Another robot, Robo, started to move. Robo said, “I am T.O.B.I. UNIT-1. This mine can be a data center. It can cool machines and heat the village. Other countries did this.” Miso was excited. “This can save our village!” she said. Then, the ground shook. Robo warned, “There is a danger signal!” Jump looked into the dark and said, “Something is there, not a person.” Robo said, “It might be Ian.” Miso’s heart beat fast. The cold air made her shake, but she felt a stronger fear. “This is not just a mine,” she said. She looked at Robo and Jump. “We will wake this village!” The river’s sound outside was like a heartbeat.</p>
