# Season 1, Episode 1 – Light Lives Beneath the Village (B2 Level)

## Story – B2 English

In Taebaek’s winter of 2025, Miso stands before the abandoned school, clutching her father’s rusty box.  
She kneels and opens it, revealing faded papers: “T.O.B.I. Project.”  
Curious, she walks to the derelict mine and pushes open the “No Entry” gate.  
A nimble robot, Jump, appears and leads her deep underground.  
They descend 400 meters. The air is cold and damp, filled with the scent of coal and oil.  
Robo, another robot, wakes up. Robo says, “This mine could become a data center. It can cool servers and heat the village.”  
Miso is both anxious and excited. Suddenly, the ground shakes.  
Robo’s eyes flash. “Warning: unknown signal detected,” Robo says.  
Jump scans the darkness. Miso, trembling, says, “We will awaken this village.”  
Above, the river echoes like a heartbeat.
