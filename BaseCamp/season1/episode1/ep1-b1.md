# Season 1, Episode 1 – Light Lives Under the Village (B1 Level)

## Story – B1 English

Miso stands in front of an empty school in Taebaek, winter 2025.  
She holds her father’s rusty metal box and finds old papers called “T.O.B.I. Project.”  
Miso is curious and walks to the old mine. The gate says “No Entry,” but she goes in.  
Cold air comes out, and a robot named Jump appears. Jump is quick and has blue eyes.  
He leads Miso 400 meters underground. In the mine, Robo wakes up.  
Robo says, “This mine can be a data center. It can cool machines and heat the village.”  
Miso is excited, but suddenly the ground shakes. Robo warns, “There is danger!”  
Jump looks around. Miso says, “We will wake the village!” The river sounds like a heartbeat above.
