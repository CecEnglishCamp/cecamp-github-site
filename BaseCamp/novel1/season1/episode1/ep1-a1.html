      Miso is at an old school in Taebaek. It is winter. The river makes a soft sound.
      She has her dad’s old box. The box is rusty. She opens it. There is a plan inside.
      The plan is about a mine. Miso goes to the mine. A robot comes. It is Jump. Jump is fast with blue eyes.
      Jump takes Miso deep in the mine. It is 400 meters down. The air is cold. Another robot, Robo, wakes up.
      Robo says, “This mine can help the village. It can make houses warm.” Miso is happy. “We can save the village!”
      The ground moves. Robo says, “Danger!” Miso is scared but says, “We will wake the village!” The river makes a sound outside.
